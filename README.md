### Background and Motivation


CO2 emissions have been tied to global warming by leading scientific studies. The impact of global warming will affect all earthlings for many years to come. Hence, we wanted to encourage our fellow humans to learn more about the drivers of greenhouse gas emissions. We also intend to explore how greenhouse gas emissions are connected to energy policies and strategies developed by countries around the world and provide insights for the audience to apply in their everyday lives.

### Data
* [CO2 Emission Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)
* [ISO Codes](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/blob/master/all/all.csv)
* [World map json data](https://gist.github.com/whatsthebeef/6361969#file-world-json)

### Website overview
* **Introduction and the Hook:** The website starts off with carefully selected set of images that show the impact of global warming and then goes on to show statistics on how CO2 emissions contribute torwards global warming.
* **Rising Insight:** The globe (map) visualization and heatmap (treemap) are paired (in synch) visualizations that show how different countries around the world contribute differently to CO2 Emissions. The heatmap ranks the countries in descending order of emission rankings while the globe viz gives a geographic perspective for those countries. Play button allows the viewer to see the changes over the years.
Clicking on a country in the heatmap or globe (map) viz can show drill down details on the selected country.
* **Rising Insight:** The Sankey visualization shows the breakdown of the CO2 emissions for the selected country. This also shows the percentage composition of the individual sources. 
* **Main Point1:** The comparison statistic block compares the selected country with respect to USA and states whether USA is higher or lower.
* **Main Point2:** The Radar visualization compares the selected country, USA and world average with respect to the percentage composition of emission sources.
* **Main Point3:** The Bump Chart visualization shows the yearly trend of CO2 emissions for the selected country, USA and world average. This allows viewer to see where the USA has made progress over the years and opportunities to improve.
* **Solution:** This section comprises of the Gauge chart along with selectable checkboxes show how each emission source can cause US emission totals go above or below the 'safe levels' (50% of world average). In addition, this section also has recommendations on how the viewer can reduce CO2 emissions and make a difference.

### Unzip the zip file into a folder and view the project structure as follows:

* cs171-co2 folder
  * css folder (style sheets)
  * data folder (data for the project)
  * js folder (javascript visualizations)
  * index.html (main page)
  * README.md (readme)
  * static folder (images and icons)

### How to run?
#### Two ways to view the website:
1. After extracting the folder structure in a IDE like WebStorm, view index.html in browser
2. View using
