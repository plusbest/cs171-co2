### Background and Motivation


CO2 emissions have been tied to global warming by leading scientific studies. The impact of global warming will affect all earthlings for many years to come. Hence, we wanted to encourage our fellow humans to learn more about the drivers of greenhouse gas emissions. We also intend to explore how greenhouse gas emissions are connected to energy policies and strategies developed by countries around the world and provide insights for the audience to apply in their everyday lives.
